/**
 * The goal is to have all of the assets in your project to be webpack's concern 
 * and not the browser's. (This doesn't mean that they all have to be bundled together). 
 * webpack treats every file (.css, .html, .scss, .jpg, etc.) as a module. 
 * However, webpack only understands JavaScript.
 * 
 * 
 * Loaders in webpack transform these files into modules as they are added to your dependency graph.
 * At a high level, they have two purposes in your webpack config.
 * 
 * 1. Identify what files should be transformed by a certain loader. (test property)
 * 2. Transform that file so that it can be added to your dependency graph (and eventually your bundle). (use property)
