New Flows:


Problems:

- get details
- correct route
- subscribe to current frame
- subscribe to start round
- global error subscription resets
- submit frame on current frame change
- submit frame subscription

Classes:

GameLoopDetailsService
    - is initial default = false;
    - subscribe details request
        - parse request
        - if is initial 
            - add subscriptions to subcriptions manager
            - init subscriptions


GameLoopManager
    - is updated default = false;
    - play round default = false;
    - is submitted default = false;
    - subscribe event new details
        - process details 
            - if play round, this.playround = true;
        - is updated = true;
        - redirect start route
    - subcribe start round events
        - play round = true
    - subscribe submit frame
        - play round = false;
    - resetForNextFrame()
        - updated = false;
        - is submitted = false;


Subscription Current frame
    - game id
    - init
        - if manager.game id != this; reset and subscribe 
    - unsubscribe
    - callback
        - new event submit frame


Subscription Start round
    - game id
    - init
        - if manager.game id != this; reset and subscribe 
    - unsubscribe
    - callback
        - new event submit start round


Correct route proposal:
    - can deactivate guard
        - manager is submitted == true?
    - can activate route correction guard 
        - subscribe latest game turn details received
            - this latest details received = true;
        - if this is latest details updated = true
            - check route
            - this latest details = false
            - return true/new route
        - else....
            - new event, request redirect
            - new event, request details 
        

Abstract component proposal:
    - on init 
        - update manager (route complete)
            - is updated = false 
            - is submitted = false
        - manager -> start round?
            - no -> show waiting for round to start overlay
        - subscribe to submit frame events
            -
