permlink:

- remove generatePermlinkCode from usersession.service.ts
- create server side implementation of generatePermlinkCode
- append to miabuser object if persistenting an anonymous user (done once)
- provide to user as part of profile details retreival for gamelist id info
- on permlink provided on landing
    - exists === true; return permlinkAuthId
    - update db.ref(miabusers/permlinkAuthId/tenant).set(authid)

db rule appends:

- miabuser 
    - read access:
        - if authid !== miabuser.authid && miabuser.isanonymous
            - return authid === miabuser.tenant

- gamelist | scrolls | games 
    - read access:
        - if authid !== (this object).(ownerid|userid) e.g. authid !== game.ownerid
            - authid === root.ref(maibuser/authid/tenant).val()

- permlinkcode
    - write access:
        - admin only (no rule)
    - read access:
        - anyone

root.child('miabuser/auth.uid/gamelist').val() ==> gameListId

root.hasChild('gamelist/{gameListId}/myGames/' + gameId)

data.hasChild('authorizedPlayers/' + authId)

1st visit to site:
-----------------------
login as anonymous
play and complete game, then miabuser object is created
no permlink code, so a new one is created

anonymous 
    - isAnonymous = true
    - authid = 1234
    - permlink code = aaab
     - gamelist 
        - myGames
            - 1111
    - association = 4321

game
    - gameid = 1111
    - owner = 8009
    - authorizedPlayers 
        - 8009
        - 1234



2st visit to site:
-----------------------
login again as anonymous
at some point u provide the permlink code
    - i update the permlink user miab object association property
play and complete game, then a miabuser is created
a permlink code was already associated so new one none is created

anonymous 
    - isAnonymous = true
    - authid = 4321
    - permlink code = aaab
    - gamelist 
        - myGames
            - 2222
    - association = 1234

game
    - gameid = 2222
    - owner = 9008
    - authorizedPlayers 
        - 9008
        - 4321

load my games, including those played with prior permlink code
- easy to validate games in miabusers gamelist; part of authorizedPlayers
- problems:
    - magically i found out that 1111 is one of my games
    - get my miab user object
    - if i have an association 
        - check if game.owner or game.authorizedPlayers === association 

3rd visit to site:
-----------------------
you register
at some point u provide the permlink code
    - i update the anonymous user miab object landlord property

registered user
    - authid = 7767
